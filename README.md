# BookRecommendationSystem
This project implements a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. It suggests books to users based on their historical preferences and book attributes.
# Overview
The recommendation system is built using Python and leverages the Pandas library for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset of books including attributes such as title, author, genre, ratings, and user reviews.
# Features
1. Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on user behavior and preferences. Implements both User-Based Collaborative Filtering and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering techniques.
2. Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books similar to those a user has liked in the past. Utilizes book attributes such as genre, author, and keywords.
3. Hybrid Models: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
